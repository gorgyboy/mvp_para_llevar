# MVP - Para Llevar

Final project for the Fundations program at Holberton School.

## Getting Started

This project intention is to create a delivery app for restaurants
and fast food vendors to have a meeting point with their clients and future
clients in small towns, where bigger apps normally don't offer their services.

Normally in these little towns, people only have one or two phone numbers to
request delivey from, not becuase they don't like other places, but because of
the lack of information.

Para Llevar looks to close this gap by connecting clients to vendors in a
telphone book/menu alike environment in which the vendors will fulfill the
delivery of food by themselves, which is normal in these little towns.
